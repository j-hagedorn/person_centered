While population health approaches may highlight the collective effect of people's needs and environments, the primary catalyst for transformation is at the level of the individual person.  This is the profound insight of *person-centered planning* (PCP), which has long been the cornerstone of Michigan policy related to behavioral health services and supports.^[See @mi-mhc.] 

While putting forward specific definitions of person-centered planning and its parts will a focus of [later sections of this document](#bok), it is worth noting at the outset that our goal is to adopt a broader scope for person-centered planning than is often seen in practice^[Even though this broader definition does conform to existing policy and guidance].  This is because, despite the central position of PCP to the Medicaid services system in Michigan, its practice has often been relegated to the planning meeting itself and the preparation for that meeting: ensuring inclusion of family and friends, personal involvement, etc.  While the act of developing a plan remains a cornerstone of the process, it is only one step needed to truly achieve one's goals.^[Part of the focus on the meeting is due to the auditing focus on the plan document: an instance of *what is measured, is addressed*.  This should serve as an abiding reminder during the implementation of the framework defined here, that there are unintended consequences to measurement.]

In this document, the phrase *person-centered planning* is used broadly, to encompass not only the initial planning process but also its implementation, monitoring, and refinement.  The extension of this definition beyond the PCP meeting and document into a framework which directs all services and supports is already recognized within state policy^[See @pcp-policy, p. 1], which indicates that:

> *through PCP, a person is engaged in decision-making, problem solving, monitoring progress, and making needed adjustments to goals and supports and services provided in a timely manner.*

The table below suggests how existing paradigms can be used to augment these policy requirements and be incorporated into our framework. Here we makes use of paradigms for [Quality of Life](#qol_intro) (QoL), [behavior change](#comb_intro) (*Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior*, or COM-B), and [continual improvement](#pdca_intro) (*Plan-Do-Check-Act*, or PDCA):

  "COM-B",   "What?",      "Turning vision into plan",  "How will I start to address my goal?",
  "PDCA",    "How?",       "Making my plan work",      "How is the plan working? How to change?"

## Making My Plan Work {#pdca_intro}

As the intent of supports and services is to improve personal quality of life, practitioners can view the PCP process as similar to the *Plan-Do-Check-Act* (PDCA) cycle, which involves many elements of the broader scope of PCP referred to above.^[While there are various other rubrics related to learning and improvement, PDCA has been selected here because of its use of 'planning' language, its simplicity, and its familiarity among behavioral healthcare providers and funders.]  Versions of the PDCA cycle have already been successfully incorporated into the supports and treatment planning process for people with varying conditions and needs, from intellectual and developmental disabilities, to mental illness, to physical health concerns.

<!-- Add refs to Arduin, MBC, etc. related to PDCA.  Note from SB: How do you think MBC fits into Person Centered Planning? MBC allows for a more objective measurement of change in symptoms/functioning but does it interfere with “person-centeredness”? -->

If we want to understand whether a person's plan is supporting his/her goals, it is necessary to have a strategy to measure improvement in the person's desired areas of focus.  Such measurement-based approaches have been gaining traction in their use across populations and been implemented in a manner which is valued by people receiving services.^[@shalock-changes notes "an increased emphasis on... conducting outcome evaluation... to assess the degree to which personal goals, positive changes, or benefits have been achieved" in IDD planning.]

Framing the intent of supports and services as improving personal quality of life through planning creates a natural bridge to using well-tested quality improvement processes at the individual level.  Rather than assuming that an objective will lead to the desired goal as it is initially written, this approach allows for trying out different approaches and revising them to find what works, in the spirit of continuous quality improevment.

The table below illustrates the relationship between the PDCA process and a fuller definition of the PCP process:

<!-- How does COM-B fit in here?  Use specific examples. Consider expanding this table (or create a separate appendix or tool that includes other questions that can be used to drive this conversation. People sometimes have trouble identifying their goals and desired changes – so we have to have lots of ways of asking the same thing, using language specific to culture, age, etc. Maybe we would just touch on this in the training curriculum. -->

Note that, while the questions above can be tied to various data-points^[See the [section on measurement](#measure) for examples of how this might be accomplished.], it is most important that they should be conversational: founded upon an ongoing process of personal striving for improvement.
