Person Centered Planning upholds the truth about healthcare;  while healthcare continues to focus on treating groups and classes of diagnoses, change is ultimately driven by the individual person.   This is the profound insight of *person-centered planning* (PCP), which has long been the cornerstone of Michigan policy related to behavioral health services and supports.^[See @mi-mhc.] 

While putting forward specific definitions of person-centered planning and its parts will be a focus of [later sections of this document](#bok), it is worth noting at the outset that our goal is to adopt a broader scope for person-centered planning than is often seen in practice^[Even though this broader definition does conform to existing policy and guidance].  This is because, despite the central position of PCP to policy regarding Medicaid supports and services in Michigan, its practice has often been relegated to the planning meeting itself and the preparation for that meeting: ensuring inclusion of family and friends, personal involvement, etc.  While the act of developing a plan remains a cornerstone of the process, it is only one step needed to truly achieve one's goals.^[Part of the focus on the meeting is due to the auditing focus on the plan document: an instance of *what is measured, is addressed*.  This should serve as an abiding reminder during the implementation of the framework defined here, that there are unintended consequences to measurement.]

In this document, the phrase *person-centered planning* is used broadly, to encompass not only the initial planning process but also its implementation, monitoring, and refinement.  The extension of this definition beyond the PCP meeting and document into a framework which directs all services and supports is already recognized within state policy^[See @pcp-policy, p. 1], which indicates that:

> *through PCP, a person is engaged in decision-making, problem solving, monitoring progress, and making needed adjustments to goals and supports and services provided in a timely manner.*

The table below suggests how existing paradigms can be used to augment these policy requirements and be incorporated into our framework. Here we makes use of paradigms for [Quality of Life](#qol_intro) (QoL), [behavior change](#comb_intro) (*Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior*, or COM-B), and [continual improvement](#pdca_intro) (*Plan-Do-Check-Act*, or PDCA):

## Vision for a Better Life {#qol_intro} 

Priorities and choices vary from person to person, yet many dimensions of what makes a good life are broadly agreed upon across people and cultures^[For more detail, see the quality of life definitions [in the measurement discussions](#qol_def) section.]: *choice, relationships, access to needed resources, physical and emotional well-being*... these are some of the dimensions which we collectively refer to as quality of life.

People usually seek services and supports because they see a gap between their current situation and a better life.  Person-centered planning encourages a person to cast a vision for their lives and to identify gaps between their hopes and their current situation.  In order to ensure a comprehensive approach, it is valuable to prompt consideration across all QoL domains in identifying goals. 

## Turning Vision into Plan {#comb_intro}

Once a person has set a vision for a better life and identified gaps between where they are and where they want to go, a map needs to be drawn.  This map draws potential routes to connect a person from where they are to where they want to be.

The COM-B model for behavioral change, an acronym for *Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior* provides a way to map out these routes.  It helps to conceptualize the facilitators and barriers to changing one's life.  Note that the goals addressed are not limited to "challenging behaviors" or related to medical issues (*e.g. weight loss, or quitting smoking*).  The behavior addressed could be as simple as any broad goal related to quality of life.

```

For instance, a person may have a goal to enrich the relationship with his/her parents.  The person's *capability* to enrich that relationship may be strained by previous trauma, difficulty communicating, or other challenges.  Perhaps they would benefit from trauma-focused therapy or simply some coaching and modelling of how to engage in difficult conversations.  If the person's parents live across town, but he/she does not have access to reliable transportation, then there is also the need to create *opportunity* to reach that goal.  This might entail gettig a bus pass, finding other transportation and additionally setting up access to phone calls or other communication platforms (e.g. FaceTime or Skype).  In this case, the person's motivation is already present.  In some other cases, such as nutrition or smoking cessation, there is often an need for *motivation*al assistance as well.  

In the example above, one is thinking through *Capacity*, *Opportunity*, and *Motivation* in order to generate ideas about how to achieve a prioritized goal.  The ideas which are generated (e.g. coaching on difficult conversations, getting a bus pass, etc.) are akin to what have typically been called *objectives* in person-centered planning.  These are the steps that a person wants to pursue in order meet a broader *goal* to improve quality-of-life.  

Note that objectives or supports identified above are not the only ones which could possibly get a person to their goal.  It may actually be the case that writing hand-written notes would be more helpful in getting this particular person to establish a closer relationship with their parents.  This is why a particular set of objectives should be viewed as a personal experiment in improving one's life.  The objectives form a hypothesis, where one is saying that doing a set of activities will facilitate the achievement of a goal. There is no reason to think that a person's first hypothesis will be correct, or even that the hypotheses of loved ones or experts must be correct.

This is where iteration and the improvement cycle come in...

## Making My Plan Work {#pdca_intro}

The *Plan-Do-Check-Act* (PDCA) cycle is a simple model for implementing a change and checking to see if it is working.^[While there are various other rubrics related to learning and improvement, PDCA has been selected here because of its use of 'planning' language, its simplicity, and its familiarity among behavioral healthcare providers and funders.]  The *QoL* and *COM-B* frameworks discussed above provide a way to identify goals and design individualized strategies to meet those goals: they fall into the *Plan* phase of the PDCA cycle.  

As the intent of supports and services is to improve personal quality of life, practitioners can view the PCP process as similar to the PDCA cycle, which involves many elements of the broader scope of PCP referred to above.  Versions of the PDCA cycle have already been successfully incorporated into the supports and treatment planning process for people with varying conditions and needs, from intellectual and developmental disabilities, to mental illness, to physical health concerns.

<!-- Add refs to Arduin, MBC, etc. related to PDCA.  Note from SB: How do you think MBC fits into Person Centered Planning? MBC allows for a more objective measurement of change in symptoms/functioning but does it interfere with “person-centeredness”? -->

If we want to understand whether a person's plan is supporting his/her goals, it is necessary to have a strategy to measure improvement in the person's desired areas of focus.  Such measurement-based approaches have been gaining traction in their use across populations and been implemented in a manner which is valued by people receiving services.^[@shalock-changes notes "an increased emphasis on... conducting outcome evaluation... to assess the degree to which personal goals, positive changes, or benefits have been achieved" in IDD planning.]

Framing the intent of supports and services as improving personal quality of life through planning creates a natural bridge to using well-tested quality improvement processes at the individual level.  Rather than assuming that an objective will lead to the desired goal as it is initially written, this approach allows for trying out different approaches and revising them to find what works, in the spirit of continuous quality improevment.

<!-- How does COM-B fit in here?  Use specific examples. Consider expanding this table (or create a separate appendix or tool that includes other questions that can be used to drive this conversation. People sometimes have trouble identifying their goals and desired changes – so we have to have lots of ways of asking the same thing, using language specific to culture, age, etc. Maybe we would just touch on this in the training curriculum. -->

Note that, while the questions above can be tied to various data-points^[See the [section on measurement](#measure) for examples of how this might be accomplished.], it is most important that they should be conversational: founded upon an ongoing process of personal striving for improvement.
