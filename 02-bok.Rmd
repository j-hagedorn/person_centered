# A Common Body of Knowledge {#bok}

A foundational effort has been working to develop a shared repository of key terms and concepts, their definitions, and how they are related to one another.  This common language has the following key features:

- Relates all terminology back to the person, who is at the center
- Includes concepts related to the PCP process, as broadly defined above, as well as common attributes for understanding the person^[Note that the body of knowledge is not intended to classify services and supports.]
- Promotes consistency in implementation and training, and the scalability of future development
- Allows for change; the language can be extended as new concepts are identified.^[This approach also requires that ideas claiming to be new must differentiate themselves from existing terms and concepts.]
- Reduces confusion across various policies with inconsistent terminology and scope
