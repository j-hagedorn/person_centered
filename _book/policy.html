<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> Comprehensive Mapping to Policy</h1>
<p>As with any important idea, person-centered planning has been discussed and debated for decades, leaving a vast body of policy, regulations, guidance, and explanations to sift through. While the basic idea of person-centered planning is simple and commonsense, practitioners are also required to adhere to complex existing policies. With this in mind, the body of knowledge is being developed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on a broad scope of relevant state and federal policies identified by MDHHS-BHDDA.</li>
<li>Using natural-language processing techniques to identify and refine core terminology from the text of the identified policies</li>
<li>In a manner that allows MDHHS-BHDDA to identify whether new federal policies would align with the current implementation of PCP</li>
</ul>
<div id="identify-scope-of-policy" class="section level2">

<p>This set of policies and regulations can be expanded as necessary.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Additional work will be needed to assure that the most current version of amended policies is used, as this approach is refined.</p>
</div>
<div id="find-occurrence-of-concepts-in-policy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Find Occurrence of Concepts in Policy</h2>
<p>The core concepts are derived from key policy documents, as defined in <a href="bok.html#bok">the previous section</a>, which allows for related terms to be flagged within other policy documents. One of the most challenging issues facing any attempt to give clear, consistent, and comprehensive guidance related to person-centered planning is the large, diverse, and continually evolving set of requirements and guidance.</p>
<p>The previous section outlined the process for deriving key concepts from state-level policies and guidelines. The next step is to identify these concepts when they occur within a much larger set of federal policies. This will allow for policy specialists to:</p>
<ul>
<li>suggest necessary refinements to the body of knowledge</li>
<li>identify relevant requirements which were previously unknown</li>
<li>identify potential discrepancies between policies which address a similar concept</li>
</ul>
<p>To do this, this analysis maps policy words and phrases with their corresponding concepts. As new policies are identified for inclusion, new synonyms for core concepts will need to be identified if new terms are introduced to refer to existing concepts.</p>
<p>The plot below shows the number of occurrences<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> of core concepts across the entire corpus of policies identified above. While the frequency of occurrence does not speak to the importance of one concept in relationship to others, it point out the number of uses of the concept in different contexts, underlining the challenge in harmonizing divergent policy language.</p>
<p><img src="person_centered_files/figure-html/plot_policy_concept-1.png" width="2275" /></p>
<!-- Note caveats and work in progress for concept mapping across federal policies -->
<p>An example may be helpful in understanding what goes into the chart above. For instance, the concept of <em>assessment</em> shown in the chart above occurs 1835 times across 22 separate policy documents.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>The table below shows a sample of the text from some of the policies where this concept is flagged:</p>
