["index.html", "A Person-Centered Framework Chapter 1 Reason", " A Person-Centered Framework Various authors 2020-03-31 Chapter 1 Reason This framework arises from a simple conviction: the intent of supports and services is to help each person flourish, to achieve a better life. That belief is thankfully not a new one. It aligns with the person-centered planning policy(“Person-Centered Planning Policy” 2017) published by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Administration (MDHHS-BHDDA), which begins by stating that: The purpose of the community mental health system is to support adults and children… to live successfully in their communities — achieving community inclusion and participation, independence, and productivity [and to] to identify and achieve their personal goals. The framework defined below is an attempt to apply these longstanding and fundamental values in a way that allows for consistent definitions, implementation, and evaluation. Each person has the ability to choose a better future, to chart a course toward it and strive to reach it: person-centered planning provides a platform to enable this process. In order for services to effectively support a person in this process, they must be provided within the context of a person’s goals. Orienting a broad and complex system to keep the person as its central focus requires a consistent, overarching framework. MDHHS-BHDDA is working to support this person-centered orientation with the following strategy: Goal: To develop a common body of knowledge for person-centered planning, mapped to relevant policies and research, which will inform a shared curriculum and measurement framework to support improved quality of life for each person.

This is the profound insight of person-centered planning (PCP), which has long been the cornerstone of Michigan policy related to behavioral health services and supports.1 While putting forward specific definitions of person-centered planning and its parts will a focus of later sections of this document, it is worth noting at the outset that our goal is to adopt a broader scope for person-centered planning than is often seen in practice2. This is because, despite the central position of PCP to the Medicaid services system in Michigan, its practice has often been relegated to the planning meeting itself and the preparation for that meeting: ensuring inclusion of family and friends, personal involvement, etc. While the act of developing a plan remains a cornerstone of the process, it is only one step needed to truly achieve one’s goals.3 In this document, the phrase person-centered planning is used broadly, to encompass not only the initial planning process but also its implementation, monitoring, and refinement. The extension of this definition beyond the PCP meeting and document into a framework which directs all services and supports is already recognized within state policy4, which indicates that: through PCP, a person is engaged in decision-making, problem solving, monitoring progress, and making needed adjustments to goals and supports and services provided in a timely manner. The table below suggests how existing paradigms can be used to augment these policy requirements and be incorporated into our framework. Here we makes use of paradigms for Quality of Life (QoL), behavior change (Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior, or COM-B), and continual improvement (Plan-Do-Check-Act, or PDCA): Table 2.1: Paradigms related to PCP Paradigm Tells us Relates to Answers QoL Why? Vision for a better life What areas of life do I want to focus on? COM-B What? Turning vision into plan How will I start to address my goal? PDCA How? Making my plan work How is the plan working? How to change? 2.1 Vision for a Better Life 2.2 Turning Vision into Plan Visualized in the graphic below:5 Figure 2.1: The COM-B Model 2.3 Making My Plan Work As the intent of supports and services is to improve personal quality of life, practitioners can view the PCP process as similar to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, which involves many elements of the broader scope of PCP referred to above.6 Versions of the PDCA cycle have already been successfully incorporated into the supports and treatment planning process for people with varying conditions and needs, from intellectual and developmental disabilities, to mental illness, to physical health concerns. If we want to understand whether a person’s plan is supporting his/her goals, it is necessary to have a strategy to measure improvement in the person’s desired areas of focus. Such measurement-based approaches have been gaining traction in their use across populations and been implemented in a manner which is valued by people receiving services.7 Framing the intent of supports and services as improving personal quality of life through planning creates a natural bridge to using well-tested quality improvement processes at the individual level. Rather than assuming that an objective will lead to the desired goal as it is initially written, this approach allows for trying out different approaches and revising them to find what works, in the spirit of continuous quality improevment. Figure 2.2: PDCA cycle applied to PCP process The table below illustrates the relationship between the PDCA process and a fuller definition of the PCP process: Table 2.2: Alignment of PDCA and PCP Factor Plan Do Check Act Questions What is your life like? What are you working on? Is life better? What next? What do you want to pursue? How are supports provided? How to improve approach? What supports do you need?

["bok.html", "Chapter 3 A Common Body of Knowledge 3.1 What is a Body of Knowledge? 3.2 Potential Uses 3.3 Identifying Core Concepts 3.4 Defining Core Concepts", " Chapter 3 A Common Body of Knowledge A foundational step to support consistency is the development of a shared repository of key terms and concepts, their definitions, and how they are related to one another. This common language has the following key features: Relates all terminology back to the person, who is at the center Includes concepts related to the PCP process, as broadly defined above, as well as common attributes for understanding the person8 Promotes consistency in implementation and training, and the scalability of future development Allows for change; the language can be extended as new concepts are identified.9 Reduces confusion across various policies with inconsistent terminology and scope 3.1 What is a Body of Knowledge? “If you wish to converse… define your terms.” — Voltaire While person-centered thinking and planning is important enough to be ensconced in policy and regulation, it is also important enough that is should never become rote, and continue to be a part of a living dialogue. Dialogue and consistent implementation require a shared language.10 Our purpose here is to identify and define concepts related to person-centered planning by making use of the existing legacy of policy and guidance related to person-centered planning. This is done in a way which connects core concepts to both state and federal regulations. The collection of core concepts is intended to serve as the foundational outline for a body of knowledge; an evolving outline of understanding about person-centered thinking, planning, implementation and monitoring.11 3.2 Potential Uses Potential uses of this body of knowledge include the following: Policy Search: searching of existing policies in electronic format to identify requirements related to each core concept Impact of Policy Changes: identification of relevant new federal policy requirements to allow for clear understanding of which current policies are related and complicated by the new federal policy Basis of Curriculum: serving as the foundation of a standard curriculum to train people receiving services, their families, direct-care team members, supports coordinators, case managers, clinicians, and others about the PCP process. Monitoring Quality: allowing for system-level monitoring of the quality of PCP practice, through measurements and/or the use of a best practice review model.12 Promising Practices: use of key terms for ongoing literature review and meta-analysis of PCP-related practices in the research literature, to build a base of best practices and evidence for effectiveness. 3.3 Identifying Core Concepts 3.3.1 What makes a concept a ‘core’ concept? In order to begin compiling relevant policies and guidance related to person-centered planning, we needed to select and define an initial set of core concepts related to person-centered planning. The ‘source of truth’ for these concepts was state-level policy in Michigan, since this is the level at which shared dialogue and consistent implementation are sought. The following method was used to develop this initial set of core concepts: Manual review and annotation of a set of core documents which define person-centered planning in the Michigan Public Behavioral Health System. These include (a) the Person-Centered Planning Policy13, (b) the Self-Determination Policy and Practice Guideline14, and (c) the Michigan Mental Health Code section 330.1712 Individualized written plan of services15. Identifying synonyms for core concepts. For instance, the term person was mapped to the similar terms person, personal, patient, individual, client, consumer, recipient, beneficiary. This is being done for all core concepts in order to flag their occurrence across multiple policies. Comprehensive annotation of electronic text data for the policies referenced above, to assure that the most commonly used terms and phrases were included as core concepts. Purposeful Word Choice. When multiple terms are mapped together to comprise a concept, a single ‘master’ term must inevitably be selected to refer to various synonyms and identify their locations across documents with varying authors, terminology, points of view and contexts. The selection of terms is purposefully opinionated, and attempts to reflect the spirit of person-centered planning defined in the state’s policy. For instance, the term ‘person’ is prefered to various other terms, since these terms tend to view the person from only one vantage point: a participant in an economic exchange, a person requiring help from others, an individual person separated of ties to others. So, while we need to find instances where these words occur in policy, the body of knowledge also intends to approach those policies with a consistent point of view, informed by a consistent set of principles. 3.3.2 Characteristics of a Person To put the person at the center of the language used, and to do so in way which promotes simplicity, we needed to bring some of the concepts from policy underneath a broader set of terms. With the person as the starting point, we define each person as having the following features: description: a set of characteristics specific to that person, defined by the person and those who know the person well. connections: the people, places and things which make up the context of a person’s life direction: what a person intends for his/her life to become, by imagining a future and making choices to move toward it Note that these are features of being human for all of us. The intent of this framework is to describe attributes of a person which are more broadly human, and not merely focused on illness or disability. While this framework is intended for implementation with Medicaid public behavioral health recipients, the approach outlined here should apply to any reader: from legislators to clinicians, from administrators and direct-care workers. Each element of the person-centered planning framework is shown above. Each concept is defined by its relation with other concepts, as well as having a distinct definition, as shown below. 3.4 Defining Core Concepts Defining core concepts and terms, using policy where possible. Table 3.1: Concept Definitions and Synonyms Concept Definition Synonyms description Features which can be attributed to the person, as opposed to his/her connections, environment, etc. attributes; characteristics direction The aspects of the person which allow him/her to imagine a future and to plan and work to achieve it personal intent; aspiration connections The relationships which a person has to the people, places and things around them circumstance;circumstances;opportunity relationships Natural relationships which the person has with other people. Does not include economic relationships or interactions with “systems”. natural supports environment The physical context in which the individual lives; here referring to the non-human environment including shelter and the natural world. location;setting;environment Note that the body of knowledge is not intended to classify services and supports.↩ This approach also requires that ideas claiming to be new must differentiate themselves from existing terms and concepts.↩ According to Will Durant, this requirement is “the heart and soul of [logic], that every important term… be subjected to strictest scrutiny and definition. It is difficult, and ruthlessly tests the mind; but once done it is half of any task.” Durant (1926)↩ Please note that the current work aims at an initial proof-of-concept, and not as a process ready for automation or scaling.↩ This could be developed similar to the MI-FAST model, which has been used to review the fidelity to evidence-based practices.↩ (“Person-Centered Planning Policy” 2017)↩ (“Self-Determination Policy and Practice Guideline” 2017)↩ (“Michigan Mental Health Code, Act 258 of 1974, Section 330.1712” 1974)↩ "],
["policy.html", "Chapter 4 Comprehensive Mapping to Policy 4.1 Identify Scope of Policy 4.2 Find Occurrence of Concepts in Policy", " Chapter 4 Comprehensive Mapping to Policy As with any important idea, person-centered planning has been discussed and debated for decades, leaving a vast body of policy, regulations, guidance, and explanations to sift through. While many of the basic ideas of person-centered planning are simple and commonsense, practitioners are also required to adhere to existing policies. With this in mind, the body of knowledge is being developed: Based on a broad scope of relevant state and federal policies identified by MDHHS-BHDDA.

One of the most challenging issues facing any attempt to give clear, consistent, and comprehensive guidance related to person-centered planning is the large, diverse, and continually evolving set of requirements and guidance. The previous section outlined the process for deriving key concepts from state-level policies and guidelines. The next step is to identify these concepts when they occur within a much larger set of federal policies. This will allow for policy specialists to: suggest necessary refinements to the body of knowledge identify relevant requirements which were previously unknown identify potential discrepancies between policies which address a similar concept To do this, this analysis maps policy words and phrases with their corresponding concepts. As new policies are identified for inclusion, new synonyms for core concepts will need to be identified if new terms are introduced to refer to existing concepts. The plot below shows the number of occurrences17 of core concepts across the entire corpus of policies identified above. While the frequency of occurrence does not speak to the importance of one concept in relationship to others, it point out the number of uses of the concept in different contexts, underlining the challenge in harmonizing divergent policy language. An example may be helpful in understanding what goes into the chart above. For instance, the concept of assessment shown in the chart above occurs 1835 times across 22 separate policy documents.18 The table below shows a sample of the text from some of the policies where this concept is flagged: doc_id text sid AFC-TA Resident admission criteria ; resident assessment plan ; emergency admission ; resident care agreement ; physician ’s instructions ; health care appraisal ( //) R.

["measure.html", "Chapter 7 Person-Centered Measurement Framework 7.1 What do we mean by ‘a better life’? 7.2 Benefits of a QoL Perspective 7.3 Alignment with Existing Requirements 7.4 Framework for Measurement", " Chapter 7 Person-Centered Measurement Framework If the entire system of services and supports is intended to be person-centered, its performance should be measured within a framework that is centered on the person. Since many existing quality measures and data collection systems were not developed with this in mind, it will be important to develop a larger framework within which existing measures can be situated. This allows the system to retain the quality measurement work that has been completed, while acknowledging gaps within that framework which need to be filled. The framework outlined here attempts to align with and fulfill the promise of current definitions of person-centered planning, as well as with existing and evolving standards in the fields of behavioral health and developmental disability services. Far from contradicting these standards, it attempts to provide a broader, person-centered context for the development of the system as a whole. Ongoing work in this area would include: Developing a person-centered measurement framework Conducting an inventory of available data assets at a state wide level Classifying existing measurement and data collection efforts (e.g. HEDIS, BH-TEDS, etc.) within the context of this framework Gap analysis of current datasets and development of a plan to address measurement gaps. 7.1 What do we mean by ‘a better life’? People have been asking themselves what it means to live a good life for thousands of years,21 and it is among the most crucial questions for each of us to answer. For the purpose of this measurement framework, we will refer to the characteristics that make up a good life as quality of life, or QOL for short, relying primarily on contemporary research to arrive at a common and usable definition. 7.1.1 What makes a good definition? If we are going to try to define quality of life, it is important that our definition gets a few things right:22 Multiple dimensions. A good life can only be described using multiple dimensions. These are influenced by personal factors, environmental factors, and the interaction between those factors. Broad enough for everyone. We should each want to apply the definition to our own lives. The basic characteristics of a good life are the same for all people, regardless of culture, gender, disability, etc. Both subjective and objective. People have different priorities. While a definition can point to objective facts related to QoL, it must include the point-of-view of the person who is living their life from day to day. Each dimension of a QoL model may have both objectively and subjectively defined indicators. Taken together, the criteria listed above seek to balance the abstract with the specific and to arrive at a definition which is well-rounded while also being understandable. 7.1.2 What makes a better life? Keeping our key requirements in mind, we can draw from the broad reservoir of studies on QoL to find frameworks which are multi-dimensional23, cross-culturally relevant,24 and which provide both subjective and objective indicators. Below is a potential model listing essential dimensions of QoL: Table 7.1: QoL Dimensions Area Dimension Example Indicators Independence Personal development Education status, personal skills, ADLs, IADLs Self-determination Choices, autonomy, personal control, goals Social participation Interpersonal relations Social networks, activities, relationships Social inclusion Community integration, participation, roles Rights Human (respect/dignity, equality), Legal Well-being Emotional well-being Safety, positive experiences, self-concept, stress Physical well-being Health, nutrition, recreation/physical exertion Material well-being Financial status, employment, housing, possessions Please note that the framework listed above is one of many potential models, each of which contains many of the same basic dimensions, and many were developed with populations having specific conditions. Some other broad-based models for review include: The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) domains. The Eurostat QoL indicators show an example of QoL domains applied for entire countries alongside financial indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP). Healthy People 2020 has selected a subset of measures for monitoring health-related QoL and well-being in the United States. See their Foundation Health Measure Report: Health-Related QoL and Well-Being. 7.2 Benefits of a QoL Perspective 7.2.1 What other frameworks exist? One might well ask: Is quality of life the only potential framework that we could use to measure improvement? The answer is No, so it is worth discussing other options and briefly reviewing the attributes of each. Other options include: Symptom reduction: Measurement of reduction in symptoms related to specific diagnosable conditions. Symptom scales such as the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and other tools have commonly been used to measure the impact of treatments on specific conditions, but they are more challenging to use for people with multiple co-occuring conditions (MCC). Improving functional status: Most currently used assessment tools address functional status, measuring the impact of various conditions on broader life areas in terms of their impact on functional ability. These are broader than symptom scales, and can detect the impact of various symptoms on a particular functional domain. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL): HRQoL addresses a subset of QoL domains which are related to perceived physical and mental health. These models typically exclude non-medical areas such as education or rights, focusing on physical domains like ‘mobility’. 7.2.2 Why is a quality of life framework better than others? A QoL approach has the following benefits over the approaches mentioned above: Strengths-based: A QoL approach asks people what they want their lives to be and encourages them to work toward that vision. Rather than focusing on needs or deficits, it aspires to use a person’s strengths to improve his or her life.25 Inclusive: Instruments and measures from each of the other areas can be used as a part of the QoL framework, since it is broad enough to include each of these areas, and they each contribute to it. A QoL approach does not neglect the value of functional gains or symptom reduction, but values these as contributors to overall quality of life. For instance, if a person experiences an alleviation of their depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9, this would be seen as contributing toward the individual’s QoL in the area of ‘Emotional Well-being’. Contextual: An approach which focuses on only a portion of an individual’s life, such as mobility or anxiety symptoms, is likely to miss out on the bigger picture. It may also inadvertently create siloes among the individuals supporting the person. For instance, more recent evaluations have criticized the HRQoL approach as failing to “sufficient emphasis on mental and social domains…that are essential to people.”26 The broader focus on QoL which is proposed here is aligned with our evolving understanding of several areas, each of which stresses the critical relationship between each of us and our communities and surroundings: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH): A vast and growing body of research indicates that the places and conditions in which we live are intrinsically tied to the quality of our lives and the likelihood of achieving positive outcomes from the supports and services we receive. Trauma-Informed Care: More and more models for service provision, informed by research and by the lived experience of trauma survivors, are founded on the recognition that adverse events in our relationships and in our lived environment can have a profound and lifelong impact on our lives.27 Supports Paradigm: A model, prevalent in the IDD supports system, that views a person’s functioning as the match between their individual capacity and the environment in which they are expected to live and work.28 In this model, supports are viewed as a way to supplement the persons strengths and to help match those to the person’s environment. 7.3 Alignment with Existing Requirements 7.3.1 Alignment with Federal Medicaid Requirements 7.3.2 Alignment with Provider Requirements Feasible for Implementation: Multiple pragmatic trials have demonstrated that the use of symptom scales are both feasible to implement on a large scale29 and acceptable to people receiving services.30 Provider Accreditation: New standards for Joint Commission accreditation (effective 2018)31 require that an organization (a) “uses a standardized tool or instrument to monitor individuals progress in achieving… goals”, (b) “gathers and analyzes data generated through standardized monitoring, and results used to inform goals and objectives of individual’s plan”, and (c) “evaluates outcomes of… services… by aggregating and analyzing data collected through the standardized monitoring effort.” Diagnostic Practice: The most recent diagnostic manual (DSM-5) includes assessment measures which were “developed to be administered at the initial patient interview and to monitor treatment progress.” 7.4 Framework for Measurement 7.4.1 Scope Figure 7.1: Scope of framework A conceptual framework as comprehensive as the one we are proposing runs the risk of becoming overwhelmingly complex and unwieldy to implement. So, before diving into any details, we want to begin by sketching out a simple way to think about the scope of the framework required to systematically measure person-centered planning and its impact of quality of life. Having a definition of scope can help us answer questions such as: What types of data are included, and what types of measures? How will we know when the framework is fully implemented? Does this fit with other work that we are doing? We can define the scope of the framework using three-dimensions (depth, breadth, and height) as defined below: Depth (a.k.a. Zoom): Does the framework allow for understanding at various levels of ‘resolution’, from the most immediate (i.e. the individual person) to the aggregate (i.e. the population) and other levels inbetween (e.g. the organization, team, etc.)? Breadth (a.k.a. Population): Can the framework apply to all people who are planning to improve their lives with the help of services and supports?32 Height (a.k.a. Steps): Does the framework allow for understanding of each of the steps in the person-centered PDCA process discussed above? Figure 7.2: If it was a cube… If we think about the framework as a cube made of these three dimensions, then developing the measurement framework can begin by making certain that data is collected: at each step of the person-centered PDCA process (height) for people across all populations (breadth) which can be aggregated at various levels of the system (depth) So, speaking very broadly, if our cube has data elements/measures at each intersection of the three dimensions, then it allows for at least a basic understanding of people’s needs, planning, and services as these contribute to improved lives. In reality, there will always be additional data that can be collected and novel ways of combining that data, just as there continue to be additional books and songs written describing the human experience. The next sections define each of the dimensions listed above, and how they relate to one another, in greater detail. Based on these details, it will be possible to begin a practical gap analysis to assess how closely the system’s current data assets match the scope of the framework. Please note that this paper does not develop or identify specific measures, except as illustrations of how individual data elements or metrics might fit into the overall framework. 7.4.2 Steps 7.4.2.1 Plan Understand Quality of Life. Understand Needs Related to QoL. The table below identifies example variables from required assessments which relate to the QoL domains outlined above.33 While this is not an exhaustive mapping, it shows how the assessment of personal needs (from the “Plan” step of PDCA) relate to quality of life domains across multiple populations. Table 7.2: Sample: Need Assessment and Related QoL Dimensions Dimension SIS Subscale CAFAS Subscale LOCUS Dimension GAIN Item Personal development Health &amp; Safety School/Work Protection/Advocacy Thinking Behavioral Support Self-determination Protection/Advocacy Engagement Interpersonal relations Social Activities Home Social inclusion Community Living Community Living Situation Social Activities Environment Rights Protection/Advocacy Legal Health &amp; Safety Emotional well-being Behavioral Support Moods/Emotions Risk of Harm Emotional health Health &amp; Safety Behavior Physical well-being Medical Support Self-Harm Co-Morbidity Physical health Health &amp; Safety Risk of Harm Disease prevention Material well-being Employment Material Needs Vocational As mentioned above, the table above is intended to illustrate how assessments of need can be tied to QoL domains, but is not comprehensive.34 The actual mapping will need to be done at the level of specific questions, as opposed to subscales which are not as likely to fit neatly within a single QoL domain. Note that instruments which contain a larger number of items (such as the SIS) are likely to have greater coverage of QoL domains than instruments with a smaller number of items (such as the LOCUS). 7.4.2.2 Do 7.4.2.3 Check When are measures taken? What types of measures relate to what parts of the PCP process? 7.4.2.4 Act 7.4.2.5 PCP-based Episodes Improvement takes time, both in our personal lives and in our collective work as organizations and systems. Various frameworks have been developed to help evaluate improvement over time, many of which rely on the concept of “episodes”: periods of time which characterized by specific events or attributes. For instance… an admission to treatment is used to define an episode in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) the course of a particular illness is used to define an episode in the National Quality Forum’s Patient-Focused Episodes of Care Neither of the approaches above is optimal for understanding the effectiveness of the implementation of a person-centered plan. The admission-based approach will create longer episodes for long-term services and supports which do not correspond to revisions of the person-centerd plan and the effect of those revisions on quality of life. The illness-based approach will be overly reductive for people with multiple, concurrent conditions, lifelong conditions, or whose social and environmental conditions have a strong adverse impact on their quality of life. If the person-centered planning (and doing, checking, acting) process is to be the primary catalyst for improvement of life using Medicaid supports and services, then that process should be used to define episodes for improvement. The ‘episode’ of a PCP cycle would correspond to the period of time between the plan and its next subsequent revision. If person-centered planning is expected to be creative, collaborative, and dynamic, then different ‘visions and revisions’ of the plan will be longer or shorter. For instance, if a person develops a plan but soon realizes that it is not helping them to achieve the life goals they intended to, then the plan would be revised and the PCP episode would relatively short. 7.4.3 Zoom 7.4.4 Population The philosopher Aristotle defined the highest good of human life as happiness, or flourishing (eudaimonia). cf.
