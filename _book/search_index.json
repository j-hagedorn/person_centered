That belief is, thankfully, not a new one. It aligns with the MDHHS person-centered planning policy(“Person-Centered Planning Policy” 2017), which begins by stating that: The purpose of the community mental health system is to support adults and children… to live successfully in their communities — achieving community inclusion and participation, independence, and productivity [and to] to identify and achieve their personal goals. The framework defined below is an attempt to apply these longstanding and fundamental values in a way that allows for consistent definitions, implementation, and evaluation. 1.1 Goal Each person’s ability to choose a better future and map their journey toward it: this is what person-centered planning enables. In order for services to effectively support a person in this process, they must be provided within the context of a person’s goals. Orienting a broad and complex system to keep the person at the center requires a consistent, overarching framework. MDHHS BHDDA is working to support this person-centered orientation with the following strategy: Goal: To develop a common body of knowledge for person-centered planning, mapped to relevant policies and research, which will inform a shared curriculum and measurement framework to support improved quality of life for each person.

This common language has the following key features: Relates all terminology back to the person, who is at the center Includes concepts related to the PCP process, as broadly defined above, as well as common attributes for understanding the person1 Promotes consistency in implementation and training, and the scalability of future development Allows for change; the language can be extended as new concepts are identified.2 Reduces confusion across various policies with inconsistent terminology and scope Note that the body of knowledge is not intended to classify services and supports.↩ This approach also requires that ideas claiming to be new must differentiate themselves from existing terms and concepts.↩ "],

While many of the basic ideas of person-centered planning are simple and commonsense, practitioners are also required to adhere to existing policies. With this in mind, the body of knowledge is being developed: Based on a broad scope of relevant state and federal policies identified by MDHHS-BHDDA. Using natural-language processing techniques to identify and refine core terminology from the text of the identified policies In a manner that allows MDHHS-BHDDA to identify whether new federal policies would align with the current implementation of PCP "]
