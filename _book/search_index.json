This is the profound insight of person-centered planning (PCP), which has long been the cornerstone of Michigan policy related to behavioral health services and supports.1 Despite the central position of PCP to the Medicaid services system in Michigan, in practice it has often been relegated to the planning meeting itself and the preparation for that meeting: ensuring inclusion of family and friends, personal involvement, etc. While the act of developing a plan remains a cornerstone of the process, it is only the first step of what is needed to truly achieve one’s goals.2 In this document and in the work under development with MDHHS-BHDDA, the phrase person-centered planning is used broadly, to encompass not only the initial planning process but also its implementation, monitoring, and refinement. The need for this definition to extend beyond the PCP meetings and to direct all services and supports is already recognized within state policy, which indicates that:3 through PCP, a person is engaged in decision-making, problem solving, monitoring progress, and making needed adjustments to goals and supports and services provided in a timely manner. Since the intent of supports and services is to improve personal quality of life, practitioners can view the PCP process as similar to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, which involves each element of the broad scope of PCP defined above. Versions of the PDCA cycle have already been successfully incorporated into the supports and treatment planning process for people with varying conditions and needs, from intellectual and developmental disabilities, to mental illness, to physical health concerns. If we want to understand whether an individual person’s plan is supporting their goals, it is necessary to have a strategy to measure improvement in the person’s desired areas of focus. Such measurement-based approaches have been gaining traction in their use across populations.4 Framing the intent of supports and services as improving personal quality of life through person-centered planning also creates a natural bridge to using well-tested quality improvement processes at the individual level. Perhaps the most applicable of these is the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, which involves each element of the broad scope of PCP defined above. The PDCA cycle has already been successfully incorporated into the supports and treatment planning process for people with varying conditions and needs, from intellectual and developmental disabilities, to mental illness, to physical health concerns. The table below illustrates the relationship between the PDCA process and a fuller definition of the PCP process: Table 2.1: Alignment of PDCA and PCP Factor Plan Do Check Act Questions What is your life like? What are you working on? Is life better? What next? What do you want to pursue? How are supports provided? How to improve approach? What supports do you need? Where do you live/work? Activities Identify QoL Work on plan Check QoL Revise plan Assess needs Coordinate services Reassess needs (Repeat cycle) Develop plan Quality area Structure Process Outcome (Re)structure While there are various other rubrics related to learning and improvement, PDCA has been selected here because of its use of ‘planning’ language, its simplicity, and its familiarity among behavioral healthcare providers and funders. Note that, while the questions above can be tied to various data-points, it is more important that they should be conversational: founded upon an ongoing process of personal striving for improvement.

Since many existing quality measures and data collection systems were not developed with this in mind, it will be important to develop a larger framework within which existing measures can be situated. This allows the system to retain the quality measurement work that has been completed, while acknowledging gaps within that framework which need to be filled. Ongoing work in this area would include: Developing a person-centered measurement framework Conducting an inventory of available data assets at a state wide level Classifying existing measurement and data collection efforts (e.g. HEDIS, BH-TEDS, etc.) within the context of this framework 7.1 What do we mean by ‘a better life’? People have been asking themselves what it means to live a good life for thousands of years,9 and it is among the most crucial questions for each of us to answer. Here, we will refer to the characteristics that make up a good life as quality of life, or QOL for short, relying primarily on contemporary research to arrive at a common and usable definition. 7.1.1 What makes a good definition? If we are going to try to define quality of life, it is important that our definition gets a few things right:10 Multiple dimensions. A good life can only be described using multiple dimensions. These are influenced by personal factors, environmental factors, and the interaction between those factors. Broad enough for everyone. We should each want to apply the definition to our own lives. The basic characteristics of a good life are the same for all people, regardless of culture, gender, disability, etc. Both subjective and objective. People have different priorities. While a definition can point to objective facts related to QoL, it must include the point-of-view of the person who is living their life from day to day. Each dimension of a QoL model may have both objectively and subjectively defined indicators. Taken together, the criteria listed above seek to balance the abstract with the specific to arrive at a definition which is well-rounded and understandable. 7.1.2 What makes a better life? Keeping our key requirements in mind, we can draw from the broad reservoir of studies on QoL to find frameworks which are multi-dimensional11, cross-culturally relevant,12 and which provide both subjective and objective indicators. Below is a potential model listing essential dimensions of QoL: Table 7.1: QoL Dimensions Area Dimension Example Indicators Independence Personal development Education status, personal skills, ADLs, IADLs Self-determination Choices, autonomy, personal control, goals Social participation Interpersonal relations Social networks, activities, relationships Social inclusion Community integration, participation, roles Rights Human (respect/dignity, equality), Legal Well-being Emotional well-being Safety, positive experiences, self-concept, stress Physical well-being Health, nutrition, recreation/physical exertion Material well-being Financial status, employment, housing, possessions Please note that the framework listed above is one of many potential models, each of which contains many of the same basic dimensions, and many were developed with populations having specific conditions. Some other broad-based models for review include: The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) domains. The Eurostat QoL indicators show an example of QoL domains applied for entire countries alongside financial indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP). Healthy People 2020 has selected a subset of measures for monitoring health-related QoL and well-being in the United States. See their Foundation Health Measure Report: Health-Related QoL and Well-Being. 7.2 Benefits of a QoL Perspective 7.2.1 What other frameworks exist? One might well ask: Is quality of life the only potential framework that we could use to measure improvement? The answer is No, so it is worth discussing other options and briefly reviewing the attributes of each. Other options include: Symptom reduction: Measurement of reduction in symptoms related to specific diagnosable conditions. Symptom scales such as the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and other tools have commonly been used to measure the impact of treatments on specific conditions, but they are more challenging to use for people with multiple co-occuring conditions (MCC). Improving functional status: Most currently used assessment tools address functional status, measuring the impact of various conditions on broader life areas in terms of their impact on functional ability. These are broader than symptom scales, and can detect the impact of various symptoms on a particular functional domain. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL): HRQoL addresses a subset of QoL domains which are related to perceived physical and mental health. These models typically exclude non-medical areas such as education or rights, focusing on physical domains like ‘mobility’. 7.2.2 Why is a quality of life framework better than others? A QoL approach has the following benefits over the approaches mentioned above: Strengths-based: A QoL approach asks people what they want their lives to be and encourages them to work toward that vision. Rather than focusing on needs or deficits, it aspires to use a person’s strengths to improve his or her life.13 Inclusive: Instruments and measures from each of the other areas can be used as a part of the QoL framework, since it is broad enough to include each of these areas, and they each contribute to it. A QoL approach does not neglect the value of functional gains or symptom reduction, but values these as contributors to overall quality of life. For instance, if a person experiences an alleviation of their depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9, this would be seen as contributing toward the individual’s QoL in the area of ‘Emotional Well-being’. Contextual: An approach which focuses on only a portion of an individual’s life, such as mobility or anxiety symptoms, is likely to miss out on the bigger picture. It may also inadvertently create siloes among the individuals supporting the person. For instance, more recent evaluations have criticized the HRQoL approach as failing to “sufficient emphasis on mental and social domains…that are essential to people.”14 The broader focus on QoL which is proposed here is aligned with our evolving understanding of several areas, each of which stresses the critical relationship between each of us and our communities and surroundings: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH): A vast and growing body of research indicates that the places and conditions in which we live are intrinsically tied to the quality of our lives and the likelihood of achieving positive outcomes from the supports and services we receive. Trauma-Informed Care: More and more models for service provision, informed by research and by the lived experience of trauma survivors, are founded on the recognition that adverse events in our relationships and in our lived environment can have a profound and lifelong impact on our lives.15 Supports Paradigm: A model, prevalent in the IDD supports system, that views a person’s functioning as the match between their individual capacity and the environment in which they are expected to live and work.16 In this model, supports are viewed as a way to supplement the persons strengths and to help match those to the person’s environment.
