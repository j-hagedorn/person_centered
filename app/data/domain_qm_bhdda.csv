113,0166,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS),"HCAHPS (NQF #0166) is a 32-item survey instrument that produces 11 publicly reported measures: 

7 multi-item measures (communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain control, communication about medicines, discharge information and care transition); and 

4 single-item measures (cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital environment, overall rating of the hospital, and recommendation of hospital).

Please note: The FY 2020 Final Rule finalized the removal of the three Pain Management questions beginning with 10/1/19 discharges.","The HCAHPS Survey asks recently discharged patients about aspects of their hospital experience that they are uniquely suited to address. The core of the survey contains 21 items that ask how often or whether patients experienced a critical aspect of hospital care, rather than whether they were satisfied with their care. Also included in the survey are four screener items that direct patients to relevant questions, five items to adjust for the mix of patients across hospitals, and two items that support Congressionally-mandated reports. Hospitals may include additional questions after the core HCAHPS items. 

HCAHPS is administered to a random sample of adult inpatients between 48 hours and six weeks after discharge. Patients admitted in the medical, surgical and maternity care service lines are eligible for the survey; HCAHPS is not restricted to Medicare beneficiaries. Hospitals may use an approved survey vendor or collect their own HCAHPS data if approved by CMS to do so. HCAHPS can be implemented in four survey modes: mail, telephone, mail with telephone follow-up, or active interactive voice recognition (IVR), each of which requires multiple attempts to contact patients. Hospitals must survey patients throughout each month of the year. IPPS hospitals must achieve at least 300 completed surveys over four calendar quarters.

under the Quality Assurance button on the official HCAHPS On-Line Web site at 

http://www.hcahpsonline.org/globalassets/hcahps/quality-assurance/2018_qag_v13.0.pdf","Eligibility for the HCAHPS Survey.
The HCAHPS Survey is broadly intended for patients of all payer types who meet the following criteria: 
 	Eighteen (18) years or older at the time of admission
 	Admission includes at least one overnight stay in the hospital 
 	An overnight stay is defined as an inpatient admission in which the patient's admission date is different from the patient's discharge date. The admission need not be 24 hours in length. For example, a patient had an overnight stay if he or she was admitted at 11:00 PM on Day 1, and discharged at 10:00 AM on Day 2. Patients who did not have an overnight stay should not be included in the sample frame (e.g., patients who were admitted for a short period of time solely for observation; patients admitted for same day diagnostic tests as part of outpatient care).
 	Non-psychiatric MS-DRG/principal diagnosis at discharge 

Note: Patients whose principal diagnosis falls within the Maternity Care, Medical, or Surgical service lines and who also have a secondary psychiatric diagnosis are still eligible for the survey. 

 	Alive at the time of discharge

Note: Pediatric patients (under 18 years old at admission) and patients with a primary psychiatric diagnosis are ineligible because the current HCAHPS instrument is not designed to address the unique situation of pediatric patients and their families, or the behavioral health issues pertinent to psychiatric patients. 

Exclusions from the HCAHPS Survey
There is a two-stage process for determining whether a discharged patient can be included in the HCAHPS Sample Frame. The first stage is to determine whether the discharged patient meets the HCAHPS eligibility criteria, listed above. If the patient meets the eligibility criteria, then a second set of criteria is applied: Exclusions from the HCAHPS Survey.

Patients who meet the eligible population criteria outlined above are to be included in the HCAHPS Sample Frame. However, there are a few categories of otherwise eligible patients who are excluded from the sample frame. These are: 
 	 No-Publicity patients who request that they not be contacted (see below)
 	Court/Law enforcement patients (i.e., prisoners); this does not include patients residing in halfway houses
 	Patients with a foreign home address (the U.S. territories Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands are not considered foreign addresses and therefore, are not excluded)
 	Patients discharged to hospice care (Hospice-home or Hospice-medical facility)
 	Patients who are excluded because of state regulations 
 	Patients discharged to nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities 

 No-Publicity patients are defined as those who voluntarily sign a no-publicity request while hospitalized or who directly request a survey vendor or hospital not to contact them ( Do Not Call List ). These patients should be excluded from the HCAHPS Survey. However, documentation of patients no-publicity status must be retained for a minimum of three years.

Court/Law enforcement patients (i.e., prisoners) are excluded from HCAHPS because of both the logistical difficulties in administering the survey to them in a timely manner, and regulations governing surveys of this population. These individuals can be identified by the admission source (UB-04 field location 15) 8 Court/Law enforcement, patient discharge status code (UB-04 field location 17) 21 Discharged/transferred to court/law enforcement, or patient discharge status code 87 Discharged/transferred to court/law enforcement with a planned acute care hospital inpatient readmission. This does not include patients residing in halfway houses.

The measure reports a single summary RSRR, derived from the volume-weighted results of five different models, one for each of the following specialty cohorts based on groups of discharge condition categories or procedure categories: surgery/gynecology, general medicine, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology. The measure also indicates the hospital-level standardized readmission ratios (SRR) for each of these five specialty cohorts. The outcome is defined as unplanned readmission for any cause within 30 days of the discharge date from the index admission (the admission included in the measure cohort). A specified set of readmissions are planned and do not count in the readmission outcome. CMS annually reports the measure for Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients who are 65 years or older and are hospitalized in non-federal short-term acute care hospitals. For the All-Cause Readmission (ACR) measure version used in the Shared Savings Program (SSP) beginning in 2017, the measure estimates an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) facility-level RSRR of unplanned, all-cause readmission after admission for any eligible condition or procedure within 30 days of hospital discharge. The ACR measure is calculated using the same five specialty cohorts and estimates an ACO-level standardized risk ratio for each. CMS annually reports the measure for patients who are 65 years or older, are enrolled in Medicare FFS, and are ACO assigned beneficiaries. The updates in this form reflect changes both to the original HWR measure and the ACS measure version. For instances where the two versions differ, we provide additional clarifications below the original description.","The outcome for both the original HWR and ACR measures is 30-day readmission. We define readmission as an inpatient admission for any cause, except for certain planned readmissions, within 30 days from the date of discharge from an eligible index admission. If a patient has more than one unplanned admission (for any reason) within 30 days after discharge from the index admission, only one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not counted as an outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.","The measure includes admissions for Medicare beneficiaries who are 65 years and older and are discharged from all non-federal, acute care inpatient US hospitals (including territories) with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission.

This reengineered measure uses clinical data elements from patients electronic health records in addition to Claims for risk adjustment.","The outcome for this measure is 30-day readmission.

If a patient has more than one unplanned admission (for any reason) within 30 days after discharge from the index admission, only one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. However, if the first readmission after discharge is considered planned, any subsequent unplanned readmission is not counted as an outcome for that index admission because the unplanned readmission could be related to care provided during the intervening planned readmission rather than during the index admission.","The measure includes admissions for Medicare beneficiaries who are 65 years and older and are discharged from all non-federal, acute care inpatient US hospitals (including territories) with a complete claims history for the 12 months prior to admission.",NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,3,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,3,FALSE

Step 1
Identify the Index Episode. Identify all Medicaid beneficiaries in the specified age range who during the Intake Period had one of the following:
 An outpatient visit, telehealth, intensive outpatient visit, or partial hospitalization with a diagnosis of AOD abuse or dependence. Any of the following code combinations meet criteria:

 An acute or nonacute inpatient discharge with one of the following: Alcohol Abuse and Dependence Value Set, Opioid Abuse and Dependence Value Set, Other Drug Abuse and Dependence Value Set.. To identify acute and nonacute inpatient discharges:
1. Identify all acute and nonacute inpatient stays (Inpatient Stay Value Set).
2. Identify the discharge date for the stay.
 A telephone visit (Telephone Visits Value Set) with one of the following: Alcohol Abuse and Dependence Value Set, Opioid Abuse and Dependence Value Set, Other Drug Abuse and Dependence Value Set
 An online assessment (Online Assessments Value Set) with one of the following: Alcohol Abuse and Dependence Value Set, Opioid Abuse and Dependence Value Set, Other Drug Abuse and Dependence Value Set
For Medicaid beneficiaries with more than one episode of AOD abuse or dependence, use the first episode. 
For Medicaid beneficiaries whose first episode was an ED visit that resulted in an inpatient stay, use the diagnosis from the ED visit to determine the diagnosis cohort and use the inpatient discharge date as the IESD. When an ED visit and an inpatient stay are billed on separate claims, the visit results in an inpatient stay when the admission date for the inpatient stay occurs on the ED date of service or one calendar day after. An ED visit billed on the same claim as an inpatient stay is considered a visit that resulted in an inpatient stay. 
Step 2
Select the Index Episode and stratify based on age and AOD diagnosis cohort. If the beneficiary has a claim with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence (Alcohol Abuse and Dependence Value Set), place the beneficiary in the alcohol cohort. If the beneficiary has a diagnosis of opioid abuse or dependence (Opioid Abuse and Dependence Value Set), place the beneficiary in the opioid cohort. If the beneficiary has a drug abuse or dependence that is neither for opioid or alcohol (Other Drug Abuse and Dependence Value Set), place the beneficiary in the other drug cohort.

The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Negative Consequences of Alcohol Use short form is comprised of 7 items. The measure and scoring instructions are available, at no cost, at: http://www.healthmeasures.net/index.php?option=com_instruments&view=measure&id=139&Itemid=992.
After confirming that all responses were provided, sum the values of the response to each question. Locate the score conversion table in the Appendix and use this table to translate the total raw score into a T-score for each respondent. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. Alternatively, one can use the free online HealthMeasures Scoring Service (https://www.assessmentcenter.net/ac_scoringservice) which automatically scores raw responses into T-scores. To learn more, see http://www.healthmeasures.net/score-and-interpret/calculate-scores/scoring-instructions

For most PROMIS instruments, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10 because calibration testing was performed on a large sample of the general population. However, Alcohol Use - Negative Consequences items were calibrated in a large sample of people from the general population and people participating in community-based substance use disorder treatment programs. All participants were screened and included only if they drank alcohol in the past 30 days. Therefore, a score of 50 likely represents individuals with more substance use issues than the general population. The T-score is provided with an error term (Standard Error or SE). The Standard Error is a statistical measure of variance and represents the “margin of error” for the T-score. 

The Brief Assessment of Recovery Capital (BARC) has a cut-off score associated with recovery. Total scores above 47 are associated with sustained recovery at 12 months posttreatment (Vilsaint et al., 2017).

The Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS, 24 items) does not have published change scores or cutoffs for severity that help guide clear change score criteria for improvement. Rather, all items are scored on a 5-point scale across all 24 items, which can be averaged. Across 28 studies, RAS scale score averages ranged from 3.14 to 4.12, with an interquartile range of 3.72-3.90 (Salzer & Brusilovskiy, 2014). The average for all reported mean scores was 3.78 +/- .19.

Two rates are reported:1.The percentage of   individuals for whom a suicide safety plan is initiated in collaborationbetween the individual and their clinician (concurrent or within 24 hours of clinical encounter). 2.The percentage of   individuals for whom a suicide safety plan is initiated AND reviewed andupdated in collaboration between the individual and their clinician within 120 days of   initiation","[Note: This is a single measure with two rates, and therefore maintains two numerators].NUMERATOR 1: Individuals in the target population for whom a complete suicide safety plan is initiated in collaboration between the individual and their clinician at the time the suicidal ideation, behavior or risk is identified (concurrent or within 24 hours of clinical encounter).NUMERATOR 2: Individuals in the target population for whom a suicide safety plan is initiated in collaboration between the individual and their clinician at the time the suicidal ideation, behavior or risk is identified 
(concurrent or within 24 hours of clinical encounter) AND reviewed and updated within 120 days of initiation during the measurement period.   Suicide safety plan (see Appendix B) is a brief intervention that involves the patient with suicidal ideation, behavior or risk and their clinician working in collaboration to identify and document a written list of warning signs,  internal coping strategies that the patient can use to stay safe without involving others, sources of support including access to professional services, and way to make their environment safe. The plan must include the following six steps where the provider helps the patient to:1Recognize the warning signs of the suicidal crisis2Learn how to employ internal coping strategies without needing to contact another person 3Understand the need and benefits of socializing with family members or others who may offer distraction from the suicidal crisis  4Contact family members or friends who may help them to resolve the suicidal crisis 5Contact mental health professionals or agencies6Identify ways to make their environment safe (e.g., reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms).","Individuals aged 18 and older presenting with suicidal ideation or   behavior symptoms (based on resultsof   a standardized assessment tool) or   suicide risk (based on the clinician?s evaluation) during the measurement period.  Age Range: Individuals aged 18 and older as of date of the baseline encounter.Suicidal ideation and behavior assessment:Suicidal ideation and behavior should be assessed using a standardized assessment tool such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) ? Screen Version Recent. The C-SSRS Screen Version Recent is a 6-item patient self-reported tool that enquires about wish for death, thoughts of suicide, suicidal thoughts with method without specific thoughts or intent, suicidal intent without and with specific plan, and suicide behavior. The intensity of the ideation is rated on a 5-point scale (1=least severe to 5=most severe) using the ideation intensity items from the Since Last Visit (January 14, 2009) version of C-SSRSS. A non-zero score on the C-SSRS Screen Version Recent indicates the need to initiate the Suicide Safety Plan and hence defines the denominator.Other patient-reported assessment tools that qualify for this measure include, but are not limited to:  Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) - Item 9The PHQ-9 is a routinely used scale in behavioral health and primary care. Item 9 of the instrument asks whether the patient has thoughts that they would be better off dead, or of hurting themselves. Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)The BHS is a self-report scale with 20 true-false items that assesses the construct of hopelessness across three dimensions: (1) feelings about the future; (2) loss of motivation; and (3) expectations.
Suicide Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS)The SIDAS has four items assessing ideation (frequency, controllability, distress, functional impairment) and one item assessing attempt (closeness to attempt).Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R)The SBQ-R is a 4-item self-report measure of dimensions of suicidality that consist of: (1) lifetime suicidal ideation and attempt; (2) frequency of suicidal ideation over the past 12 months; (3) threat of suicide attempt; and (4) self-reported likelihood of future suicidal behavior.Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation (PANSI)The Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation (PANSI) Inventory is a 14-item self-report instrument. PANSI was developed to assess the frequency of suicidal ideation that incorporates both negative risk and protective factors. PANSI is composed of two factors: six items of positive ideation (PI) and eight items of negative ideation (NI).Suicide risk assessment: The Clinician Rating of Potential Suicide Risk (CRPSR) is a single item clinician-rated tool that was developed and tested during the DSM-5 Field Trials. The assessment tool includes a listing of risk factors for suicide and a description of a what very high-risk patient might look like. The clinician is asked to consider the list of risk factors and the description of a very high-risk patient in their clinical evaluation of the patient and to rate the patient?s risk for suicide and the need for suicide prevention to be a part of the patient?s current clinical management. A non-zero score on the CRPSR indicates the need to initiate the Suicide Safety Plan. The CRPSR item is rated on a 5-point scale (See Appendix B): 0 = Lowest Concern (no prior or current concern about suicidal behavior)1 = Some Concern (prior history of suicidal ideation or behavior but preventing suicidal behavior is not a focus of the current clinical management of the patient)2 = Moderate Concern (preventing suicidal behavior is a part of current clinical management but less important than other components of the treatment plan)3 = High Concern (preventing suicidal behavior is one of the main goals in the current clinical management of the patient)4 = Imminent Concern (preventing suicidal behavior is the most important goal in the current clinical management of the patient)Other clinician rated assessment tools that qualify for this measure include, but are not limited to: Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation & Triage (SAFE-T), SAFE-T Protocol with C-SSRS (Columbia Risk & Protective Factors) Lifetime/Recent.",NA,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,4,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,2,FALSE
