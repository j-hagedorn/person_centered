# Reason
 
This framework arises from a simple conviction: the intent of supports and services is to help each person flourish, to achieve a better life.

That belief is thankfully not a new one.  It aligns with the person-centered planning policy[@pcp-policy] published by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services' *Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Administration* (MDHHS-BHDDA), which begins by stating that:

> *The purpose of the community mental health system is to support adults and children... to live successfully in their communities â€” achieving community inclusion and participation, independence, and productivity [and to] to identify and achieve their personal goals.*

The framework defined below is an attempt to apply these longstanding and fundamental values in a way that allows for consistent definitions, implementation, and evaluation.

Each person has the ability to choose a better future, to chart a course toward it and strive to reach it: person-centered planning provides a platform to enable this process.  In order for services to effectively support a person in this process, they must be provided within the context of a person's goals. Orienting a broad and complex system to keep the person as its central focus requires a consistent, overarching framework.  MDHHS-BHDDA is working to support this person-centered orientation with the following strategy:

**Goal:** To develop [a common body of knowledge](#bok) for person-centered planning,
mapped to [relevant policies](#policy) and [research](#research),
which will inform a [shared curriculum](#curriculum)
and [measurement framework](#measure)
to support [improved quality of life](#pcpdca) for each person.
